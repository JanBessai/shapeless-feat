## Shapeless Generic Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Data Types for Scala

This project brings [testing-feat](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/testing-feat) from Haskell over to Scala. The generics approach used in feat fits well with [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless), hence the name and out of the box support for generic programming.

You may find detailed information about feat in the paper by Duregård et al.:
